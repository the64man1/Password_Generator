# Password_Generator

Here is my Password Generator.<br><br> 

Users must enter a length between 8-128 characters for their password, and select at least one option of lower case, upper case, numeric and special characters, or the program terminates.<br><br>

The generated password appears in the box above the button. Users can press the button and restart the program to generate a new password.<br><br>

I modified the starter code so that, if the program terminates because a user did either cancelled the program during length selection, or did not select at least one character type, the placeholder text is not replaced be"undefined".<br><br>
